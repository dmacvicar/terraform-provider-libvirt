# TODO

- [x] Consolidate README and codegen README so they are not redundant; keep only the essentials in each
- [x] Keep the XML <-> HCL mapping rules centralized in `docs/schema-mapping.md` and make sure both READMEs point to it (no block syntax)
- [x] Document the codegen documentation tools (docindex/docgen) and link to them from the main README
- [x] Remove or update references to obsolete tools (e.g., doclint) and dead pipelines
- [ ] Review/adjust the generated docs YAML once the new guidance is in place to confirm correctness
- [x] Improve the docgen prompt to surface valid values/examples using RNG context and the IR paths (plan drafted in `internal/codegen/README.md`)
- [x] Keep the codegen README focused on tricky cases and exceptions rather than repeating the main README
