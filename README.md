___
This is a terraform provider that lets you provision
servers on a [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/) host via [Terraform](https://terraform.io/).

## Introduction & Goals

This project exists:

* To allow teams to get the benefits [Software Defined Infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_infrastructure) Terraform provides, on top of classical and cheap virtualization infrastructure provided by Linux and [KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org)
  This helps in very dynamic [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps), Development and Testing activities.
* To allow for mixing KVM resources with other infrastructure Terraform is able to manage

What is *NOT* in scope:

* To support every advanced feature [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/) supports

  This would make the mapping from terraform complicated and not maintanable. See the [How to contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) section to understand how to approach new features.

## Getting started

The provider is available for auto-installation from the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/dmacvicar/libvirt/latest).

In your `main.tf` file, specify the version you want to use:


```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    libvirt = {
      source = "dmacvicar/libvirt"
    }
  }
}

provider "libvirt" {
  # Configuration options
}
```

And now run terraform init:

```
$ terraform init
```

### Creating your first virtual machine

Here is an example that will setup the following:

+ A virtual server resource

(create this as main.tf and run terraform commands from this directory):
```hcl
provider "libvirt" {
    uri = "qemu:///system"
}
```

You can also set the URI in the LIBVIRT_DEFAULT_URI environment variable.

Now, define a libvirt domain:

```hcl
resource "libvirt_domain" "terraform_test" {
  name = "terraform_test"
}
```

Now you can see the plan, apply it, and then destroy the infrastructure:

```console
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
$ terraform destroy
```

Look at more advanced examples [here](examples/) and check the [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/dmacvicar/libvirt/latest/docs).

## Manual installation

You can also manually download the provider from the [releases section](https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt/releases) on Github. To install it, refer to the [Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/config/config-file.html#provider-installation).

## Building from source

-	[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) is required for building.

```
git clone https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt.git
cd terraform-provider-libvirt
make
```

The binary will be called `terraform-provider-libvirt`.

### Using multiple hypervisors / provider instances

You can target different libvirt hosts instantiating the [provider multiple times](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#multiple-provider-instances). [Example](examples/v0.12/multiple).

### Using qemu-agent

From its documentation, [qemu-agent](https://wiki.libvirt.org/page/Qemu_guest_agent):

>It is a daemon program running inside the domain which is supposed to help management applications with executing functions which need assistance of the guest OS.

Until terraform-provider-libvirt 0.4.2, qemu-agent was used by default to get network configuration. However, if qemu-agent is not running, this creates a delay until connecting to it times-out.

In current versions, we default to not to attempt connecting to it, and attempting to retrieve network interface information from the agent needs to be enabled explicitly with `qemu_agent = true`, further details [here](https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt/blob/master/website/docs/r/domain.html.markdown). Note that you still need to make sure the agent is running in the OS, and that is unrelated to this option.

Note: when using bridge network configurations you need to enable the `qemu_agent = true`. otherwise you will not retrieve the ip adresses of domains. 

Be aware that this variables may be subject to change again in future versions.
