# Terraform Documentation

This directory contains the portions of [the Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/) that pertain to the
core functionality, excluding providers and the overall configuration.

The files in this directory are intended to be used in conjunction with
[the `terraform-website` repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-website), which brings all of the
different documentation sources together and contains the scripts for testing and building the site as
a whole.
