# This Dockerfile builds on golang:alpine by building Terraform from source
# using the current working directory.
#
# This produces a docker image that contains a working Terraform binary along
# with all of its source code, which is what gets released on hub.docker.com
# as terraform:full. The main releases (terraform:latest, terraform:light and
# the release tags) are lighter images including only the officially-released
# binary from releases.hashicorp.com; these are built instead from
# scripts/docker-release/Dockerfile-release.
